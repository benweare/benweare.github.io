I am a Research fellow in Electron Diffraction at the University of Nottingham. 

## Current Research

My work focusses on adapting transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) into electron diffractometers, so that I can use them to solve the structures of crystals too small for X-ray techniques. I do this by writing some software in Python and DM Script. 

I am also involved in developing low-voltage TEM alignment, generally pushing conventional TEMs past their limits, and writing scripts to streamline TEM data processing.

## Past Research

I did my PhD at the University of Nottingham, where I learned to use a TEM in order to study covalent organic frameworks. 

My Masters focussed on synthetic chemistry to prepare halogenated small molecules that were used for electron radiation studies, again using a TEM.
