<p>I am a Research fellow in Electron Diffraction at the University of Nottingham.</p>

<h2 id="current-research">Current Research</h2>

<p>My work focusses on adapting transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) into electron diffractometers, so that I can use them to solve the structures of crystals too small for X-ray techniques. I do this by writing some software in Python and DM Script.</p>

<p>I am also involved in developing low-voltage TEM alignment, generally pushing conventional TEMs past their limits, and writing scripts to streamline TEM data processing.

<p>I did my PhD at the University of Nottingham, where I learned to use a TEM in order to study covalent organic frameworks.</p>

<p>My Masters focussed on synthetic chemistry to prepare halogenated small molecules that were used for electron radiation studies, again using a TEM.</p>
